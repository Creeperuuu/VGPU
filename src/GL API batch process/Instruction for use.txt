# Put gl32.h and Batch_.c in the same directory.

# Compile and run Batch_.c.


# But I built this Batch.c mainly to help me automate some 
# tedious and repetitive but important works, 
# such as copying each GL function and making some similar changes.

# And It is mainly used to help build a GL implementation framework.
